This is a script I made to load, sort and work with the Kaggle 8a.nu database. The database was a SQL database to which i exported into a CSV file. 

Essentially there are 3 parts:

1. Load data
2. Sort data by either using dictionaries to sort or add reasons to only include or exclude data (added many parameters to do this)
3. Graph data
